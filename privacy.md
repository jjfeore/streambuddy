# BanzaiBot

## What information does BanzaiBot obtain and how is it used?

**User Provided Information**

BanzaiBot asks that you authorize its use with Twitch. This authorization allows BanzaiBot to make certain authenticated requests via the Twitch API, such as getting information on your subscribers. This authorization will also allow BanzaiBot to alter your channel's metadata, such as your title, game, status, etc. None of these alterations or requests are made without your explicit verbal instruction via the Alexa skill.

**Automatically Collected Information**

We don't collect any data automatically, other than what's publicly-available through the Twitch API.

## Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by BanzaiBot?

No. Your information is accessible by you, and you alone. The code for this Alexa skill is open for analysis at any point on [Github](https://github.com/jjfeore/streambuddy/). 

## What are my opt-out rights?

If you no longer wish to provide BanzaiBot access to this information, you can opt-out at any point by removing the Alexa skill. You can also go to your [Connections](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections) under Twitch Settings and disconnect the app. Be aware that disconnecting the app via the Twitch Setting will make it so that BanzaiBot is no longer able to function.

## Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information

We don't retain any of your data.

## Children

Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the Twitch service, and authorization through Twitch services should not be possible. If you are a parent and become aware that your child is using Twitch services, please contact Twitch directly.

## Security

We don't store any of your confidential information. If your security is compromised, it will only be as a result of a compromise of another supporting service.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and informing you via email or via any other method we have to reach you.

You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

## Your Consent

By using our Applications, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.

"Processing" means using cookies on a computer, mobile/Device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States.

If you reside outside the United States your information will be transferred, processed and stored there under United States privacy standards.
